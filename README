Bin_Py Repository
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my repository where I put various Python scripts. The reason behind this is that
I want to learn Python and rewriting all my scripts in Python instead of Bash might be a
good exercise. Also, for some tasks, Object Oriented programming is very useful.

Trackpoint.py
    This script is for modifying the behaviour of a trackpoint device on Thinkpad
    computers. It should be easily customizable and fast. However, it must be run as
    root in order for the effects to be visible.

    All the configuration is done in a separate file called myconfig.

# vim: tw=88:spell:spelllang=en_gb
